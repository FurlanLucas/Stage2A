In case the content of a CHM file is not displayed on your PC, it's still locked by Windows due to security reasons. This is normal for CHM files coming from a remote source, such as the internet.

Unfortunately, LabView requires CHM or HLP file format for VI help files, because other formats, such as PDF, cannot be used to directly jump to specific pages in the document.
In order to show the content of the CHM file it may suffice to copy it to a local drive. If that doesn't help, it has to be unlocked.

Instruction on how to unlock a CHM file can be found on the internet by searching for "unlock CHM content" or "CHM shows no content". You may also look directly here:
